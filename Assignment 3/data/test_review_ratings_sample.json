Poke burrito concoction is becoming a big thing with the recent opening of Soho Sushi Bowlrrito, Pokeman, To See Roll and Sweet Poke. \n\nWith so many sushi burrito places opening up, the biggest question is...what makes each shops different from each other? Is it the quality? quantity? price? service? sauce? From the looks of it, seems that they all have similar toppings with similar protein choices at similar price ranges. On my visit to Sweet Poke, I constantly found myself comparing this place to my favorite place, Pokeman. \n\nPrice was $1-2 cheaper. Same great quality fish but I actually got more. I ordered their regular burrito and they generously packed 4 scoops of salmon in my burrito. With other toppings included, they packed so much that they couldn't even roll my fat burrito. They did, but seaweed was split in half with rice and toppings spilling out from all over the place. This much food and I paid around $9 with tax. What a deal. My burrito turned out to be one ginormous but delicious burrito that I am drooling over as I write this review thinking about it. \n\nBowl seemed to be a bit disappointing. We got a large and regular bowl. Difference was that large comes with 4 scoops of rice while regular comes with 3. It felt like they were about the same portions which was a bit odd. Paid more, yet portion was exactly the same. I did like how it came in a microwave safe bowl that can be reused at home. Great for packing your lunch to school or work. \n\nI will be back here. Great quality, great price and friendly service. I'm a fan.", "date": "2016-07-22 21:50:57"}

Vegetables are a \"hit and miss\", it's not always the best quality, some days yhe veggies are dried up and some days they're quite fresh. Meat is average price and usually fresh, this is the only market that sells chicken wings-mid joint only.\n\nThe small food court is overall a good deal, they have Honey BBQ Pork, Roast pork, Roast duck, Soy chicken sokd by the pound, taste is acceptable. They also offer plate lunches, take out style like Panda Express. The choices vary and taste is OK.\n\nDIM SUM, they have a small dim sum station, offering the basic/popular dishes.  Taste is not the best, but good for a quick fix, I order a few things to eat witb the kids before we get groceries.", "date": "2015-07-09 19:13:23"}

I remember the 90's frozen yogurt craze. Hell they even devoted a Seinfeld episode to it! \n\nI see tons of froyo and cupcake places popping up. Most of them are just trying to catch the streak du jour. Yogurtland seems to have it down to a science. You need four things to be the froyo king.\n\n1. Location. (215 & Eastern) not gonna be much more convenient than that.\n\n2. Cost (.30 cents an ounce) might as well be free!\n\n3. Variety (between the dozens of flavors they rotate and the hundreds of toppings, you can't get bored)\n\n4. Volume (you don't want any of number 3 above to sit for long) \n\nThis location has them all covered. Great outside seating for a bonus! We have had some challenges among friends to see who can get and eat the largest concoction. ($8 and change is the current leader) \n\nHappy yogurting to you!", "date": "2010-08-10 16:20:16"}

I do love their chocolate dipped strawberries!\n\ni also love their wild mushroom soup.\n\nBellagio's buffet used to be my favorite - #1.. until the day i fell in love w/ Wynn's Buffet. don't get me wrong, i still enjoy my times at bellagio's, just that it's no longer my first choice.", "date": "2009-04-07 18:34:33"}

They sat us immediately and the server was really friendly. Great truffle fries.  The menu has an americanized British spin.  Lots of tvs everywhere to catch the latest game.  Service and food was prompt.  Good place for lunch if you are Caesars. Lots of bat seating as well as dining room seating.", "date": "2016-04-11 07:04:21"}

Service almost as fast and conscientious as In & Out, but the burger is fresher and juicer.  More like a Fatburger, but not quite.  So between an In & Out burger and a Fatburger you'll find Tommy's.  With good chili from Steak & Shake.\n\nIf you've never been to In & Out or Fatburger or Steak & Shake you should go at least once.  Or not.  As you wish.", "date": "2008-08-07 23:43:56"}=
